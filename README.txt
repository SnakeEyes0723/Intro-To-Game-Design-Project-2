Project Description: Top-down, level based game for one player made using Gamemaker.

Instructions: As the player, your goal is to guide a blind man and his seeing-eye dog to the flag at the end of each level. You have a total of three lives for the entire game, with a life being lost if either the dog or his owner come into contact with an enemy or an obstacle. Your cursor is used to create paths that the dog and his owner will follow, with the path following the cursor at all times during a level. Clicking will create a pivot in the path, pressing the A key will delete the previous pivot, and pressing space will start the man and dog's movement along the path. Be warned though, once they start moving, they cannot be stopped. 

Cheat Codes:
- Ctrl+R: Restart game
- Ctrl+E: End game
- Ctrl+W: Go to WinRoom
- Ctrl+L: Go to LoseRoom
- Ctrl+H: Reset health to full
