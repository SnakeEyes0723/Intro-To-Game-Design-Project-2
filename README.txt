Instructions: 
Click on the start button on the Title Screen to start the game.
Your goal in the levels is to create a path that both the dog and its owner can safely follow, without hitting any obstacles along the way.
You can click anywhere on the level screen to create a point that bends the path, pressing the 'A' key will remove your previous point.
Pressing the spacebar makes the dog and its owner start to move along the path, and can be done at any time.
You may plan out your entire path from the beginning or continue to create your path as the player moves.

Cheat Codes: 
- Pressing Ctrl and R at the same time resets the game back to the title screen.
- Pressing Ctrl and E at the same time exits the game entirely. (Temporary)
